## Objective
1. Design a starvation-free algorithm using TestandSet shown in class.
2. Design a mutual exclusion algorithm using Swap shown in class.

## How to run
Entry point is the main function in `Main.java`. You can compile and run it with:

```
javac Main.java
java Main
```

## Change mutex option
In `Main.java` you can set `useTestAndSet` variable to `true` if you want to use testAndSet algoritm, `false` if you want to use swap algorithm.

You can check out `Explanation.md` to see my explanations about the algorithms.
